# Project Title: Heart Rate Monitoring System

## Description:
This project aims to develop a heart rate monitoring system using data from optical sensors and video sources. The system processes the sensor data and video frames to calculate heart rate and visualize the heart beat signal. It includes signal processing techniques such as filtering and peak detection to enhance signal quality and accurately detect heart beats.

## Features:
1. Loading and visualization of heart beat signal data.
2. Signal processing steps including noise removal and filtering.
3. Heart rate calculation using peak detection algorithms.
4. Visualization of detected peaks and heart rate in the signal.

## Usage:
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Open your preferred Python environment.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
3. Open the main Python script (`main.py`) in your Python IDE or text editor.
4. Ensure that all required libraries are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal or command prompt.
5. Run the main script (`main.py`) by clicking on the 'Run' button in your IDE or by typing `python main.py` in the terminal.
6. Follow the prompts displayed in the console to load data and visualize heart rate information.
